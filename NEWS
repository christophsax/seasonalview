Bug fixes:

- do not add empty x11 = "" at the end of the R call
  https://github.com/christophsax/seasonalview/issues/10
- 'auto expand' of R and X-13 box was buggy and has been removed
  https://github.com/christophsax/seasonalview/issues/12
- add 'err_to_html' to seasonal, which was removed from the seasonal package, 
  causing an application crash on error.
- less verbosity on the console. No output is written, unless it's a bug.


0.2  2017-02-11
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the hood:

- better way to pass stuff to shiny app, using shinyOptions().
- uses import.spc() from seasonal 1.4 for X-13 spc parsing.
- workaround functions to properly import xts, which depends on zoo functions, 
  so that seasonalview can be imported from other packages, such as seasonal. 
  This will be reworked once a new version of xts is on CRAN.

Bug fixes:

- Fixed issue that led to a crash when X-13 code was manipulated.
